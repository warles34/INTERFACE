The Baka pyramid, also known as Unfinished pyramid of Zawyet el'Aryan is the term Archaeologists and Egyptologists use to describe a huge, unfinished pyramid at Zawyet el'Aryan in Egypt. It is dated back by scholars to the early or the midst of the 4th dynasty during the Old Kingdom period. Its owner is not known for certainty, most Egyptologists think it should be a king known under his hellenized name, Bikheris.
