The second round begins, and Iris is given the choice of stabbing someone in the thigh with an icepick, or whipping Travis three times with a sjambok. Travis tells Iris to whip him as he does not want to see someone else get stabbed. Later, Lucas is forced to whip Travis, then Travis has the choice of stabbing Lucas or letting Bevans whip him. Travis once again chooses to be whipped. The dilemma then travels to Peter, who can stab Linda or whip Travis again, most likely leading to his death. Peter tells Linda that they have to work together, and that another beating will kill Travis. Peter stabs Linda in the leg, attempting to not hit a major vein, but fails, leading to Linda's death. As the turn heads to Amy, she chooses to stab Iris. The turn goes to Cal, who agrees with Amy when she said the game was about survival, and whips Travis, most likely killing him (though Bevans said that he may survive for several hours or days.)
