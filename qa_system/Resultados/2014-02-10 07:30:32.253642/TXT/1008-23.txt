I've seen a computer from Korea, and it's keyboard is equipped with the ability to type Korean and English letters. While I know I won't be changing what my keys look like anytime soon, is there a way to make it so that I can type in Korean with my keyboard, perhaps with the same setup as a Korean computer, and maybe just put little decals on each key. Maybe there is something I could download...does anybody know? Thanks for any help. Chuck 08:39, 30 April 2006 (UTC)
