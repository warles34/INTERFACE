The next day, Abby expresses interest in emigrating to the United States and working with Cable in his search for the Swamp Thing. Cable cannot guarantee he will find work for Abby but keeps his promise to have her registered as a U.S. citizen in due time. During the plane trip to Cable's homeland, (on which Swamp Thing stowed away) Matt and Abby are confronted by a monstrous werewolf and the man's deranged parents in the Scottish moors, who want to remove their son's curse by a total blood transfusion with Matt Cable. Swamp Thing destroys the werewolf with a silver chandelier and saves Matt and Abby yet again, allowing them to safely depart for America.
