Since US bitcoin exchanges are regulated as money services businesses, they are obligated to report activity suspicious of money laundering.[citation needed] Two men were arrested in January 2014 on charges of money-laundering using bitcoins: Charlie Shrem, the head of defunct bitcoin exchange BitInstant and vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, and Robert Faiella. Shrem allegedly allowed Faiella to purchase large quantities of bitcoins and to use them to buy illegal drugs on black-market websites.
