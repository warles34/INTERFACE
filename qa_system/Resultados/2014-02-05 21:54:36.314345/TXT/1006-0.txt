Dexter occasionally behaves in a way that suggests that he does feel some rudimentary human connection. He acknowledges loyalty to family, particularly to his late adoptive father, saying, "If I were capable of love, how I would have loved Harry." Since Harry's death, Dexter's only family is his sister Debra, Harry and Doris' biological daughter. Dexter admits that he cannot hurt Debra or allow anyone else to harm her because he is "fond of her". In the first episode of Season 1, he says that "I don't have feelings about anything, but if I could have feelings at all, I'd have them for Deb." In the first season, his relationship with Rita sets in motion his slow but steady introduction to human feelings, progressing further with each season. During one episode, when his current target is a psychologist, Dexter infiltrates his office by posing as a patient, where the doctor speculates that part of Dexter's problem in admitting to his feelings is his need for control. In the final episode of the TV show's second season, he finally admits that he needs the people in his life.Season 3, when he is threatened by a target, he fights to live because he wants to see his unborn child. In the fourth season, before killing a police officer who has murdered her own husband and daughter, Dexter is overwhelmed with the realization that he does not want to lose his new family. He is also horrified when he witnesses one of his potential victims abusing his family; Dexter vehemently insists he is nothing like that and would never hurt his family. In Season 5, after Rita is murdered, Dexter realizes that he genuinely loved her, and is devastated at losing her.
