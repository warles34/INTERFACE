NAT modifies the IP address information in IPv4 headers while in transit across a traffic routing device. This presents some drawbacks in terms of the quality of Internet connectivity and requires careful attention to the details of its implementation. In particular, all types of NAT break the originally envisioned model of IP end-to-end connectivity across the Internet, while Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT) makes it particularly difficult for systems behind a NAT to accept incoming communications. As a result, NAT traversal methods have been devised to alleviate the issues encountered. NAT has become a common, indispensable feature in routers for home and small-office Internet connections.
