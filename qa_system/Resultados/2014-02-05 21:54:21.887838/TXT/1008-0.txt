We also fix a set of term constants for the base types. For example, we might assume a base type nat, and the term constants could be the natural numbers. In the original presentation, Church used only two base types:  for "the type of propositions" and  for "the type of individuals". The type  has no term constants, whereas  has one term constant. Frequently the calculus with only one base type, usually , is considered.
