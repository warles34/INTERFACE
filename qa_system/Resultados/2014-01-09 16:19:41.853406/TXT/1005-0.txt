It is now known that during the Martian day, the sky is a scarlet or bright orangeish-red color.[citation needed] Around sunset and sunrise, the sky is rose in color, but in the vicinity of the setting Sun it is blue. This is the opposite of the situation on Earth. At times, the sky takes on a purplish color, due to the scattering of light by very small water ice particles in clouds.
