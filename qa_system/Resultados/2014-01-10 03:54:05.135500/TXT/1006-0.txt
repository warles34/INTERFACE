Abby's father (Richard Jenkins) murders a man and collects the blood, but accidentally spills it. While playing with the Rubik's Cube, Abby's hunger distracts her and she goes off to hunt by pretending to be hurt, then attacking a concerned passerby, Jack (Chris Browning), who happened to be one of her neighbors. This reveals that Abby is a vampire. On another night, the father hides in the back of a high school studentâ€™s car, wearing a black rubbish bag over his head to conceal his identity. His plan to subdue only the driver is foiled when the driver picks up a passenger. When the driver stops at a gas station, the father murders the passenger and tries to flee, but crashes the car in a nearby ditch and becomes trapped inside. He pours concentrated sulfuric acid on his face, disfiguring himself and preventing his identification. He is taken to the hospital, which leads into the opening scene. Abby learns of what happened on the local news and climbs up the hospital building to the 10th floor to see her father. She knocks on the window and asks if she could come in. The father points to his throat, unable to speak, and leans out of the window. Abby drinks his blood. The father passes out and falls to his death.
