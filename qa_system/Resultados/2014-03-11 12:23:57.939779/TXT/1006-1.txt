On March 2, 2011, Apple announced a version of GarageBand for the iPad.drums, a sampler, and various "smart instruments". It also acts as a multitrack recording studio with Stompbox effects and guitar amps. Songs can be emailed or sent to an iTunes Library. Additionally, projects can be imported to GarageBand for OS X, where they can be further edited. This also allows instruments from the iOS platform to be saved into the software instrument library on the Mac. The app is compatible with iPhone 3GS or higher, the third generation iPod Touch or higher, and all versions of the iPad, including the iPad Mini. As of version 2.0, the app is free, but requires an in-app purchase for all of the instruments and sounds.
