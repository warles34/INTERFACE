On July 19, 1692, Sarah Good was hanged along with four other women convicted of witchcraft.Reverend Nicholas Noyes was persistent, but unsuccessful, in his attempts to force Good to confess. When Sarah Good was claimed guilty by the judges especially Nicholas Noyes, she yelled out, "I'm no more a witch than you are a wizard, take my life and God will give you blood to drink."
