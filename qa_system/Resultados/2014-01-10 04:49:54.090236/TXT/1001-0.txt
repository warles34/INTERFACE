The Nazi German government stated that its occupation was against the Allies and that Germany did not intend to disturb the political independence of Denmark.occupation of Denmark was thus relatively mild at first. German propaganda even referred to Denmark as the "model protectorate".King Christian X retained his throne, and the Danish government, the Rigsdag (parliament) and the national courts continued to function. Even censorship of radio and the press was administered by the Danish government, rather than by the occupying German civil and military authorities.
