I've made many changes, trying to be more NPOV and to reflect the majority's view that seat belts help save lives. I have tried to do this without imposing my personal point of view, and respecting the view that seat belts are a bad thing. I welcome any remarks. I also think that there are much more studies backing seat belts than criticizing them, and I think this should be reflected in the article. Please add any other information you may have.
