I always wonder if there has been a period of time when the English people said "if it pleases you" instead of just "please", as the French says s'il vous plait. I can imagine the German used bitten as an adverb at the very beginning, but i can't imagine the same thing about "please"...--K.C. Tang 00:17, 27 April 2006 (UTC)
