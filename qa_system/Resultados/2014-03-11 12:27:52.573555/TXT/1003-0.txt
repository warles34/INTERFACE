The key combination consists of Alt, SysRq and another key, which controls the command issued (as shown in the table below). Users with a keyboard layout other than QWERTY have to remember that their layout becomes QWERTY when they use one of these combinations. For example, on a Dvorak keyboard, the key below '9' and '0' counts as an 'o', not as an 'r', so it shuts the system down instead of switching the keyboard from raw to XLATE mode. Furthermore, some keyboards may not provide a separate SysRq key. In this case, a separate "PrintScrn" key should be present. Under graphical environments (such as GNOME or KDE) 'Alt'+'PrintScrn/SysRq'+key combination generally only leads to a screenshot being dumped. To avoid this Print Screen feature the magic SysRq combination should include the Ctrl, becoming 'Ctrl'+'Alt'+'SysRq'+key. For the same purposes the AltGr key, if present, can be used in place of the Alt key. On some laptops SysRq is accessible only by pressing 'Fn'. In this case the combination is a bit trickier: hold 'Alt', hold 'Fn', hold 'SysRq', release 'Fn', press key. The magic SysRq can also be accessed from the serial console.
