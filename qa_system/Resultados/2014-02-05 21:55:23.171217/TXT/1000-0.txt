One study done by Drs. Camille Parmesan and Gary Yohe from University of Texas, Austin shows the global fingerprint of climate change on natural systems. The results of their global analysis of 334 species were recorded to demonstrate the correlation of patterns consistent with global climate change of the 20th century. Using the IPCC's (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) ‘levels of confidence’, this study proved significant nonrandom behavioral changes due to global climate change with very high confidence (>95). Furthermore, an accuracy of 74-91% change in species has displayed predicted change for species in response to climate change.
