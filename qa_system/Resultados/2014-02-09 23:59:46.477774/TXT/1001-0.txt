Xeroderma is a very common condition. It happens more often in the winter where the cold air outside and the hot air inside creates a low relative humidity. This causes the skin to lose moisture and it may crack and peel. Bathing or hand washing too frequently, especially if one is using harsh soaps, can contribute to xeroderma. Xeroderma can be caused by a deficiency of vitamin A, vitamin D, systemic illness, severe sunburn, or some medication.choline inhibitors. Detergents such as washing powder and washing-up liquid can cause xeroderma.[citation needed]
