interesting... so...'Nevesh' (lol) is a lastname...well, not Nevesh,but Neves since I believe it's supposed to be in spanish... does anyone know the origin of this lastname and what language is it in?Â :| now I'm confused... since, this lastname, belongs to a person which looks of latin american ancestry to me, but not so much, more like a mix of caucasian and latin american races, but anyway, the point is that, this guy likes to call himself as a nickname 'erno neveseck'...so I supose he must be of hungarian ancestry if he knows about the language and the novel... but also, the lastname could be spanish or even mexican, who knows...the world is full of weird lastnames, lol.--Cosmic girl 18:49, 18 April 2006 (UTC)
