Do Brits, from their point of view, when hearing an Aussie accent, consider it just as foreign as a North American accent? Or do they find it quite a bit more similar? (I'm not talking about the vocabulary...there the Aussies are on their own little planet of boggeriboos and widgeriwoosÂ :) which I'm sure are much more foreign to Brits than whatever idioms North Americans have dreamed up.)
