Kristján Loftsson, owner of the whaling company Hvalur (Icelandic for Whale) which had to diversify from its main industry for the past 20 years, has stated that there is no reason they can't continue hunting whales for eternity by sustainable management of the hunting. The company's whaling ship, Hvalur 9, has caught seven Fin Whales since the government authorization, but has ceased hunting for the year due to bad weather and little daylight. Loftsson also indicated that he planned to export the meat to Japan as neither Iceland or Japan are subject to a trade ban, although Claire Sterling, of the International fund for Animal Welfare, said that Japan has officially stated that it would not be buying Icelandic whale meat.
