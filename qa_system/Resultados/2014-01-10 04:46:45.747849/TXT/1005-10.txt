Iceland's return to commercial whaling was announced on May 27, 2013, as millionaire Kristjan Loftsson stated that his two whaling vessels would become operational again in June 2013. Up to 184 endangered fin whales will be hunted over the northern summer of 2013 and a portion of the haul will be used to supply Japan's luxury dog food market.
