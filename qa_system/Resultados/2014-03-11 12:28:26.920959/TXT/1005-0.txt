The sthalapuranam of gokarna then available in Tamil as it was a part of Tamil Kingdoms during sangam times, has the following account. Inorder that Brahma who out arrogance arising out of his power to create the universe, sat penancing to redeem himself from curse of shivan, lord shiva appeared in front of him from the ears of a cow. So the place came to be known as gokarnam or ear of the cow. The sangam period writings refer to a class of chieftains going by names kocar and kilans, in charge of the region between gokarnam and present day Mumbai. Even though the Tamil saints have revered this temple, their composed hymns on the same are not available to us as of today.[citations needed].
