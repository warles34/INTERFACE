In an age-old practice is made out of dried cow dung cakes in a Vaideeka mode during the annual Maha Sivarathri festival. In what is typically described as Sivarathiri Muttan, the cow dung cakes are prepared and dried and placed in layers in a pyramidal formation made out of Karukkai (not Kadukkai. Karukkai is semi grown paddy). On the morning of Sivarathiri, Viraja homam is performed. Then after homam, the fire is placed on the muttan and it burns out after some days and the cakes of cow dung burnt are to be used as Vibhuti. The cow dung from Indian breed cows are best used and foreign cows like Jerseys or mixed breeds are to be avoided. It is not clear whether commercially available packs conform to these preparation norms, as they neither indicate contents or the preparation procedure. Tests show Siddhanathan = Toxic paper factory waste and Skanda Vilas = fine crystalline rock powder. Still some make from Desi (Bos indicus) dung bratties.
