Scriptures say that Vibhuthi should not wasted by spilling it in on floor or walls after receiving it as a Prasaad(consecrated substance) from a Shiva Temple. Goddess Bhoomi Devi(the Goddess of Earth) cannot tolerate the weight of certain substances. They are Vibhuthi, Tulsi (basil) leaves, Sacred Deepa (lamp), Sacred Thread, due to their sacredness. So,they are kept over an Asanam (throne) to give respect to those articles. They are not kept on the floor directly.
