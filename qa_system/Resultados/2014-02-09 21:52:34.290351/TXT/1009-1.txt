The Civil Rights Act of 1866 also said that any citizen has the same right as a white citizen to make and enforce contracts, sue and be sued, give evidence in court, and inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.

Using language very similar to that of the Equal Protection Clause in the newly-proposed Fourteenth Amendment, the Act discussed the need to provide "reasonable protection to all persons in their constitutional rights of equality before the law...."
