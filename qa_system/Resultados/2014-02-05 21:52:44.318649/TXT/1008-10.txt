A question has puzzled me for long: in Chinese the character 矢 (pinyi:shi) can mean both "arrow" and "shit" (though the more commonly used character for "shit" is 屎, also pronounced "shi"); in English we have "shit" vs. "shoot", and in German Schiss vs. schiessen... is the similarity only a lovely coincidence? or the concept of excrement and flinging arrow somehow resemble each other? could you guys give some examples in other languages to illustrate the problem?--K.C.
