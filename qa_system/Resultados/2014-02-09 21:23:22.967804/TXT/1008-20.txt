You may want to take a look at the sites I linked above to see the whole of the song. I left out all the repetitions and the "hng âh, pfn âh, kng âh aajeeeee aajoo". If anybody is willing to take a look at this, and to have a really good laugh, I'm perfectly willing to send him a sample in mp3 format. Also, I don't quite trust the transcription. We're going to do a reading in Vienna next weekend, and I'd dearly love to amuse the audience by playing this absurd bit of music from the 80s and then do a pseudo-serious scholarly analaysis of it. So... anybody willing to have a go and further the cause of pure art? --Dr. Zarkov 01:47, 25 April 2006 (UTC)
