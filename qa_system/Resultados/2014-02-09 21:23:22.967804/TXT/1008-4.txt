After a bit more thinking about this, I think there's something else at play here...as a native speaker of German, I just use the language and have never learned much about its grammar, so I might be off quite a bit, but from observing my own and others' speech patterns, it seems that the neutral es is almost always used in simple indicative sentences of the form "It is something", regardless of the gender of the "something". It would be perfectly normal to say "Es ist ein toller Wagen" although Wagen is masculine, or to say "Was ist da so hell? Es ist die Sonne", contradicting my example above. It can even happen that the neutral es is used when referring to a person, compare "Weil Paul ein netter Kerl ist, ist er mein bester Freund" versus "Wenn jetzt jemand klopft, ist es wahrscheinlich Paul". It seems to work similarly in English: "Because Paul is a jolly good fellow, he is my best friend" vs. "If somebody is knocking at the door now, it is probably Paul". I guess there's some underlying logic to this (in the first example, I am explicitly referring to Paul as a person, while in the second example, i am referring to a neutral act of knocking that is probably executed by Paul), but as I said, I never really studied German grammar...
