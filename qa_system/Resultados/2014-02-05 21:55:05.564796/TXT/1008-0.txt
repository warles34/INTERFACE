Thanks for the replies so far. At home I have no problems, I eat a healthy diet (I do check from time to time by measuring everything I eat and then input that on various online diet advice webpages to check if the total fat, protein etc. intake relative to the total calorie intake is ok.) Only when I'm away on vacation are there problems, because of the total quantity of food I eat. It's not a matter of money, I do eat pretty much my stomach full as I do at home, but if there isn't enough fat in the diet for a few days in a row, you will start to feel hungry all day. Last year, it was a bit worse than this time. Then on the last day I had ordered more potatoes but even after eating that and having a completely full stomach I was feeling extremely hungry, as if I had eaten nothing at all. In the end, this is a simple matter of asking that the vegetables be fried with 50 grams of fat but then not getting that 50 grams of fat with the vegetables.
