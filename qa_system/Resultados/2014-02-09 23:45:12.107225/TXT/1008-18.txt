To me (northeastern Welsh) British accents are very distinct - I was reading a chapter of Voices (connected to a BBC radio series) in a bookshop yesterday, which noted how accents can change drastically over a couple of miles. While I'm not one of those people who used to claim to be able to identify where people came from to within a few streets, I can often place someone to a small group of counties. Anyway, to come back to the question at hand, the Australian accent is nothing like any British accent I know; I have trouble distinguishing a New Zealand accent from Australian, unless they're referring to Maori-origin terms, or to the number "sex". I did once mistake someone from Stourbridge (English west midlands) as having a South African English accent, it's very similar! I'm not usually much good at distinguishing Canadians from the General American accent, until I spend a few days in Canada, after which it becomes fairly straightforward. I find the best way to place North Americans in the UK is to ask "So where in Canada do you come from?" - USians will just say "no, actually I'm from..." without taking umbrage, while Canadians will be delighted that you noticed. -- Arwel (talk) 01:12, 24 April 2006 (UTC)
