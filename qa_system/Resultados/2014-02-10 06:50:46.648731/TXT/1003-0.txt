Although it is generally undisputed that athletes and bodybuilders need an increased intake of protein, the exact amount is highly individualized and dependent on the type and duration of the exercise as well as the physiological make up of the individual. Age, gender, and body size may vary this protein intake.muscle hypertrophy in the one hour window following intensive exercise[citation needed]. Moreover, for athletes who do not have the time to prepare whole food meals on the run or immediately after exercise, a protein shake may be preferred for practical as well as performance reasons. Additionally, some studies suggest low-calorie dieters, vegetarians, haphazard eaters and those who train very heavily may benefit significantly from protein supplements.[citation needed] and that excessive daily intake can cause weight gain, kidney problems, osteoporosis, or diarrhea. However, many bodybuilders report consuming hundreds of grams of protein per day to achieve maximal strength gains, so this nutrition requirement may only apply to the general public.[citation needed] Taking an overdose of protein can lead to a loss of appetite, which may be useful for some dieters.osteoporosis occurs from excessive protein intake because protein can put pressure on the kidneys and lead to bone loss due to calcium leaching.et al. (1988) showed that for bodybuilding individuals, 1.90 g of protein per kg of body weight per day is recommended, whereas endurance athletes require 1.34g/kg/d of protein. Their findings indicated that protein requirements are actually much lower than might be expected and that protein supplements therefore may not be as effective as is popularly believed. However, it should be noted that both of these levels are significantly higher than the levels claimed to be necessary for the general population (0.8 g protein / kg body weight).anaerobic and aerobic exercise. Endurance athletes in aerobic activity may have increased daily protein intake at 1.2–1.4 g per kg body weight per day where strength training athletes performing anaerobic activity may have increased daily protein intake needs at 1.4–1.8 g per kg body weight so as to enhance muscle protein synthesis or to make up for the loss of amino acid oxidation during exercise.
