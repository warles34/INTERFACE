Death by coconut refers to deaths caused by coconuts, typically as a result of the fruit falling from trees and striking people on the head. Following a 1984 study on "Injuries Due to Falling Coconuts," exaggerated claims spread concerning the numbers of deaths by coconut. Unsubstantiated claims that coconuts kill 150 persons a year have become a widely circulated urban legend. The legend gained momentum after a noted expert on shark attacks claimed in 2002 that falling coconuts kill 150 people worldwide each year. The claim has often been compared with and used to trivialize the number of shark-caused deaths per year, which is approximately five.
