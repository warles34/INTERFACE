The second commercially released version was produced by (and usually credited to) Frankie Knuckles, and still featured Principle on vocals. This edition of the song is considered a classic in the house genre. It became a hit in Chicago clubs and beyond after its 12" release in 1987 on US label Trax Records, and again after its subsequent licensing to UK and Belgian labels in 1989. These records all bill Frankie Knuckles as the main artist, and only some give any credit to Principle.
